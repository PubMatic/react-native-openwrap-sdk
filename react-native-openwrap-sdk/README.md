# OpenWrap SDK

OpenWrap SDK lets publishers leverage the power of OpenWrap to request multiple programmatic bids for their mobile in-app inventory. OpenWrap sends an initial ad call that goes out to OpenWrap partners requesting bids. When OpenWrap programmatically arrives at the winning bid, it returns the ad to OpenWrap SDK to render it in your app.

## Benefits

- All the demand sources bid at the same time, replacing the sequential preferential ordering of buyers.
- Advertisers have the chance to obtain the best ad inventory.
- Publishers can potentially see up to a 50% monetization increase.
